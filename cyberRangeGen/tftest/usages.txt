Scenario 1 employs a complex cyber exercise to assess Electronic Empire’s preparedness against a diverse set of cyber threats, following the SmartHome product launch. The methodology in- tegrates real-world cyber threat simulations, in- cluding email compromise, malware attacks, in- sider threats, DDoS, ransomware, cyber espi- onage, data loss, and unauthorized access inci- dents. This scenario tests the company’s inci- dent response strategies, technical defense capa- bilities, and decision-making processes, involving roles such as Incident Responders, SOC Analysts, Security Engineers, and the CISO, to foster a hands-on understanding of navigating a multi- threat cybersecurity landscape.

The scenario simulates a targeted attack by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group on a medium-sized financial services company. The APT group aims to gain unauthorized access to sensitive financial data, establish persistence, and exfiltrate data over an extended period without detection. The company's infrastructure includes a mix of Windows and Linux servers, employee workstations, and network devices. The APT group employs spear-phishing, exploitation of known vulnerabilities, lateral movement, and data exfiltration techniques. Participants will play the role of the company's security operations center (SOC) team, tasked with detecting, analyzing, and mitigating the attack. They will need to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), track the attacker's movements, and respond to the intrusion while minimizing damage.

This scenario simulates a ransomware attack targeting a large healthcare organization's network. The attack begins with the compromise of an employee's workstation via a phishing email, leading to the deployment of ransomware across critical systems, including patient databases, medical devices, and administrative services. The ransomware encrypts files, disrupts operations, and demands payment in cryptocurrency to restore access to the systems. Participants will play the role of the healthcare organization's Incident Response Team (IRT). Their task is to identify the attack's entry point, stop the spread of the ransomware, and recover encrypted data while ensuring the continuity of patient care. They will also need to communicate with stakeholders, including hospital management, law enforcement, and possibly the ransomware operators. The scenario will emphasize the importance of swift response, network segmentation, backup strategies, and incident communication in a high-stakes environment where lives may be at risk.
